            "question": "Animals can express their needs using a lot of ways. For instance, almost all animals have distinct vocals (声音) that they rely on to either ask for help,  scare away any dangerous animals or look for shelter. But cats are special creatures who possess amazing vocalization skills. They are able to have entire conversations with humans using meows and you're able to interpret it. If a pet cat is hungry, it will keep meowing to attract attention and find food. However, when a cat is looking for affection, they tend to produce stretched and soft meows. Meowing starts as soon as a baby cat is brought to life and uses it to get the mother's attention and be fed. \nCats have many heightened senses, but their sense of smell is quite impressive. They use their noses to assess their environment and look out for any signs of danger. They will sniff out specific areas before they choose a place to relax. However, another way the cats are able to distinguish between situations is by looking for familiar smells. Your cat will likely smell your face and store the smell in its memory and use it to recognize you in the future. That's why most pet cats are able to tell immediately if their owners were around any other cats, which they don't usually like. \nDogs are known for their impressive fetching habit, but cats take this behavior up a notch. Many cats will find random objects outside and bring them to their owners. This is a very old habit that's been present in all kinds of predators (食肉动物). Cats bring gifts for their owners to show they love you. These adorable little hunters are just doing something that it's been in their nature since the beginning of time. So just go along with it!\n4. What can be learned about cats' meowing from the first paragraph?\nA. It's a survival skill.\tB. It's taught by mother cats.\nC. It's hard to interpret.\tD. It's getting louder with age.\n5. How does a pet cat assess different situations?\nA. By listening for sounds.\tB. By touching familiar objects.\nC. By checking on smells.\tD. By communicating with other cats.\n6. Which best explains the phrase \"take. . . up notch\" in paragraph 3?\nA. Perform appropriately.\tB. Move faster.\tC. Act strangely.\tD. Do better.\n7. What is a suitable title for the text?\nA. Tips on Finding a Smart Cat\tB. Understanding Your Cat's Behavior\nC. Have Fun with Your Cat\tD. How to Keep Your Cat Healthy",

For instance, almost all animals have distinct vocals (声音) that they rely on to either ask for help, scare away any dangerous animals or look for shelter. (动物可以用很多方式来表达他们的需求。例如，几乎所有的动物都有独特的声音，它们依靠这些声音来寻求帮助，吓跑危险的动物或寻找庇护。)”和“Meowing starts as soon as a baby cat is brought to life and uses it to get the mother’s attention and be fed. (猫宝宝一出生就开始喵喵叫，喵喵叫是为了引起妈妈的注意和被喂食。)”可知，猫叫声是一种生存技能。故选A。\n【5题详解】\n细节理解题。根据第二段“Cats have many heightened senses, but their sense of smell is quite impressive. They use their noses to assess their environment and look out for any signs of danger. (猫有许多敏锐的感官，但它们的嗅觉令人印象深刻。它们用鼻子来评估周围的环境，寻找任何危险的迹象。)”可知，宠物猫通过检查气味来评估不同情况。故选C。\n【6题详解】\n词句猜测题。根据第三段划线词前半句“Dogs are known for their impressive fetching habit,  (狗以其令人印象深刻的抓取习惯而闻名)”和后句“Many cats will find random objects outside and bring them to their owners. (许多猫会在外面随意找到一些东西，并把它们带给主人。)”可知，狗以取回东西而闻名，但猫可以从外边找到东西带回来，因此在这一行为上更上一层楼。短语take ... up a notch是用来形容猫在带回东西这一行为上做得更好或更出色。故选D。\n【7题详解】\n主旨大意题。根据第一段“Animals can express their needs using a lot of ways.( 动物可以用很多方式来表达他们的需求。)”及全文可知，文章都在介绍和解释猫的各种行为方式，包括叫声、嗅觉和带回礼物的习惯，以及这些行为背后的原因和意义。所以“Understanding Your Cat’s Behavior(了解你的猫的行为)”作为文章标题最为合适。故选B。",

            "question": "The Saint Lukas train doesn’t accept passengers — it accepts only the sick. The Saint Lukas is one of five government-sponsored medical trains that travel to remote towns in central and eastern Russia. Each stop lasts an average of two days, and during that time the doctors and nurses on board provide rural (乡村) populations with basic medical care, X-ray scans and prescriptions. \n“People started queuing to make an appointment early in the morning,” says Emile Ducke, a German photographer who traveled with the staff of the Saint Lukas for a two-week trip in November through the vast regions (区域) of Krasnoyarsk and Khakassia. \nRussia’s public health care service has been in serious need of modernization. The government has struggled to come up with measures to address the problem, particularly in the poorer, rural areas east of the Volga River, including arranging doctor’s appointments by video chat and expanding financial aid programs to motivate doctors to practice medicine in remote parts of the country like Krasnoyarsk. \nThe annual arrival of the Saint Lukas is another attempt to improve the situation. For 10 months every year, the train stops at about eight stations over two weeks, before returning to the regional capital to refuel and restock (补给). Then it starts all over again the next month. Most stations wait about a year between visits. \nDoctors see up to 150 patients every day. The train’s equipment allows for basic checkups. “I was very impressed by the doctors and their assistants working and living in such little space but still staying focused and very concerned,” says Ducke. “They were the best chance for many rural people to get the treatment they want. ”\n8. How is the Saint Lukas different from other trains?\nA. It runs across countries.\tB. It reserves seats for the seniors.\nC. It functions as a hospital.\tD. It travels along a river.\n9. What can we infer from paragraph 3 about Krasnoyarsk?\nA. It is heavily populated.\tB. It offers training for doctors.\nC. It is a modern city.\tD. It needs medical aid.\n10. How long can the Saint Lukas work with one supply?\nA. About a year.\tB. About ten months.\nC. About two months.\tD. About two weeks.\n11. What is Ducke’s attitude toward the Saint Lukas’ services?\nA. Appreciative.\tB. Doubtful\tC. Ambiguous.\tD. Cautious.",

Each stop lasts an average of two days, and during that time the doctors and nurses on board provide rural(乡村)populations with basic medical care, X-ray scans and prescriptions.

            "question": "“I didn’t like the ending,” I said to my favorite college professor. It was my junior year of undergraduate, and I was doing an independent study on Victorian literature. I had just finished reading The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot, and I was heartbroken with the ending. Prof. Gracie, with all his patience, asked me to think about it beyond whether I liked it or not. He suggested I think about the difference between endings that I wanted for the characters and endings that were right for the characters, endings that satisfied the story even if they didn’t have a traditionally positive outcome. Of course, I would have preferred a different ending for Tom and Maggie Tulliver, but the ending they got did make the most sense for them. \nThis was an aha moment for me, and I never thought about endings the same way again. From then on, if I wanted to read an ending guaranteed to be happy, I’d pick up a love romance. If I wanted an ending I couldn’t guess, I’d pick up a mystery (悬疑小说). One where I kind of knew what was going to happen, historical fiction. Choosing what to read became easier. \nBut writing the end — that’s hard. It’s hard for writers because endings carry so much weight with readers. You have to balance creating an ending that's unpredictable, but doesn’t seem to come from nowhere, one that fits what’s right for the characters. \nThat’s why this issue (期) of Writer’s Digest aims to help you figure out how to write the best ending for whatever kind of writing you’re doing. If it’s short stories, Peter Mountford breaks down six techniques you can try to see which one helps you stick the landing. Elizabeth Sims analyzes the final chapters of five great novels to see what key points they include and how you can adapt them for your work. \nThis issue won’t tell you what your ending should be — that’s up to you and the story you’re telling — but it might provide what you need to get there.\n12. Why did the author go to Prof. Gracie?\nA. To discuss a novel.\tB. To submit a book report.\nC  To argue for a writer.\tD. To ask for a reading list.\n13. What did the author realize after seeing Gracie?\nA. Writing is a matter of personal preferences.\nB. Readers are often carried away by character.\nC. Each type of literature has its unique end.\nD. A story which begins well will end well.\n14. What is expected of a good ending?\nA. It satisfies readers’ taste.\tB. It fits with the story development.\nC. It is usually positive.\tD.

            "analysis": "（1）词义指代题。根据第一段Given the astonishing potential of AI to transform our lives，we all need to take action to deal with our AI﹣powered future，and this is where AI by Design：A Plan for Living with Artificial Intelligence comes in.This absorbing new book by Catriona Campbell is a practical roadmap addressing the challenges posed by the forthcoming AI revolution（变革）.（考虑到人工智能改变我们生活的惊人潜力，我们都需要采取行动来应对人工智能驱动的未来，这就是《我的设计：人工智能生活计划》的由来。卡特里奥娜•坎贝尔（Catriona Campbell）撰写的这本引人入胜的新书是一本实用的路线图，旨在应对即将到来的人工智能革命带来的挑战。）以及第二段In the wrong hands，such a book could prove as complicated to process as the computer code（代码） that powers AI but，thankfully，Campbell has more than two decades' professional experience translating the heady into the \nunderstandable.（在错误的人手中，这样一本书可能会被证明像驱动人工智能的计算机代码一样复杂，但谢天谢地，坎贝尔有20多年的专业经验，可以将令人兴奋的内容转化为可理解的内容。）可推出In the wrong hands指的是写这种书的人，所以\"If written by someone less competent.如果是由不太称职的人写的。\"是正确的。故选C。\n（2）推理判断题。根据第二段In the wrong hands，such a book could prove as complicated to process as the computer code（代码） that powers AI but，thankfully，Campbell has more than two decades' professional experience translating the heady into the understandable.She writes from the practical angle of a business person rather than as an academic，making for a guide which is highly accessible and informative and which，by the close，will make you feel almost as smart as AI.（在错误的人手中，这样一本书可能会被证明像驱动人工智能的计算机代码一样复杂，但谢天谢地，坎贝尔有20多年的专业经验，可以将令人兴奋的内容转化为可理解的内容。她从一个商业人士（而非学者）的实际角度出发，撰写了一本非常通俗易懂、内容丰富的指南，读完后会让你觉得自己几乎和人工智能一样聪明。）可知根据文本，AI by Design的特点是它采用了一种接地气的写作风格。故选B\n（3）推理判断题。根据倒数第二段Campbell's point is to wake up those responsible for AI—the technology companies and world leaders—so they are on the same page as all the experts currently developing it.She explains we are at a\"tipping point\"in history and must act now to prevent an extinction﹣level event for humanity.We need to consider how we want our future with AI to pan out.Such structured thinking，followed by global regulation，will enable us to achieve greatness rather than our downfall.（坎贝尔的观点是唤醒那些对人工智能负责的人——科技公司和世界领导人——这样他们就能与目前开发人工智能的所有专家站在同一条战线上。她解释说，我们正处于历史的\"转折点\"，现在必须采取行动，防止人类发生灭绝级事件。我们需要考虑我们希望人工智能的未来如何发展。这种结构化的思维，加上全球监管，将使我们走向伟大，而不是走向衰败。）可知关于人工智能\n的发展，坎贝尔敦促人们.共同努力控制它。故选C。\n（4）目的意图题。根据最后一段AI will affect us all，and if you only read one book on the subject，this is it.（人工智能将影响我们所有人，如果你只读一本关于这个主题的书，那就是这本书。）可知作者写这篇文章的目的是推荐一本关于人工智能的书。故选A。",
