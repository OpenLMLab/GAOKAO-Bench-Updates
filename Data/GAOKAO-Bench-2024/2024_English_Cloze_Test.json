(基本上，它意味着只吃你身体需要的食物，你应该在用餐结束时感到满足，但不要太饱)”指出，进餐时不要吃太饱，吃东西要适量。下文“But it doesn’t mean saying goodbye to the foods you love.

(控制情绪化进食)”以及下文“Many of us also turn to food to deal with unpleasant emotions such as sadness, loneliness, or boredom.(我们中的许多人也会求助于食物来处理不愉快的情绪，如悲伤、孤独或无聊)”可推知，本段主要建议读者不要情绪化的进行暴饮暴食，要进行健康饮食。B项“我们吃东西并不总是为了充饥。”指出有些人吃东西并不总是为了充饥，引出下文有些人通过食物发泄情绪，符合语境。故选B项。\n【20题详解】\n设空处位于段首，总结全段，下文“A healthy breakfast can start your metabolism (新陈代谢), while eating small, healthy meals keeps your energy up all day, Avoid eating late at night.
